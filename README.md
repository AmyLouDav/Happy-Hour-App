# Ironhack Project-2 
By Amy Davies, Carolina Romanos, Snehith Reddy.

**Introduction**

The project is to make an application in which the user can search for cocktail recipes, depending on which ingredients they have at home. Once they are logged in, they can also add their own recipes to our cocktail database. The recipes will be able to be rated by other users and credited to the creator.

**Description**

We will be using the API www.thecocktaildb.com to generate information based on the user's request.

The API will provide:

- An image of the cocktail
- The name of the cocktail
- If the cocktail is alcoholic or non-alcoholic
- Glass type
- Ingredients
- Instructions

Users will be able to filter recipes based on what alcohol they have at home. If the user has a dusty bottle of whiskey at the back of their cupboard (which is unlikely!) they can search for recipes which specifically contain whiskey.

The user will also be able to generate a random cocktail from the API if they would like a surprise. The API provides a random cocktail function which will be utilised here.

As well as using the API to provide recipes to our users, we will also have a database where users can add their own favourite recipes. Users will be able to log in to their user account and create, read, update and delete their own cocktail creations. Users will be able to read recipes added by other users as well as being able to rate them and see the username of the writer, creating a community of cocktail lovers.
